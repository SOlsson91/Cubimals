# Project 1

Game-project 1 for group 8 at Futuregames 2020 Skellefte√• developed with Unity 2019.4.12f1 (LTS)


Welcome to Cubimals where you and a friend needs to help eachother get back to safety through obstacles that has been put in your path by the storm. **To be able to play together one of you needs to have a keyboard and the other one has to have a controller**


You've got 3 lives to share between you. If you loose all of your lives it's game over and you'll have to start all over again. You control your character with [WASD] keys and [LS] on controller, and you jump with [Space] or [A] on the Xbox controller. Objects you can interact with such as buttons can be interacted with the [F] key and [B] button on controller. Note that the same buttonplacements for the Xbox also works for the Dual Shock.


You have 4 animals at your disposal which you need to use to overcome certain obstacles. Use [Q] to switch between them or [Y] on Xbox. You use the animalspecific ability with the [E] key or [X] on Controller.

The animals have different traits which you'll need to either switch to or combine to overcome the dangers ahead:
* Rabbit - Can charge his jump into a bigger jump
* Turtle - Slow on land but the only one that can cross water
* Cow - Is strong enough to push certain object others can't
* Horse - Faster than the others and can even dash forwards
